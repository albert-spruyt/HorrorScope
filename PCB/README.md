# HorrorScope PCB design

These are the kicad source files for our 'horrorscope' PCB. You can find gerbers in the 'horrorscope' directory.

(The 'breakout' directory contains gerbers for the breakout PCB we developed for debugging, which may be interesting too.)

Obviously .. we are not electrical engineers. Or good at PCB design. But it works! :)
